<h3>Post Form</h3>

<%= form_for(@post) do |f| %> <!--it already has access to @post instance variable, it will know if it's put or post but whether record is in database. f is iterator variable that allows dynamic assignment-->
<label>Post title:</label><br>
  <%= f.text_field :title%><br><!-- form_for gives access to FormBuilder which refactors this, :title automatically tells form field what model attribute and auto-fills if it's pre-exisiting record -->

  <label>Post Description</label><br>
  <%= f.text_area :description%><br>

  <%= f.submit %>
<% end %>
